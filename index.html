            <p>The former world number one, Kumari hails from the Ratucheti village in Jharkhand. The 21-year old has won
                three consecutive silver medals at the World Championships and also secured two gold medals at the 2010
                Commonwealth Games.
                
                Her father was an auto rickshaw driver, and she used to practise archery with bamboo bows and arrows. She is
                now training at the Tata Archery Academy in Jamshedpur for the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="players1">
            <p>India’s Olympic silver medallist in 2012, Kumar belongs to a small village known as Hasrour, which only houses 60 families. It is located in the Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh. In addition to his Olympics heroics, he has won five gold medals and one silver across two Commonwealth Games.

                The 29-year old serves as a Subedar Major in the Indian Army and is supported by the Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ)</p>

            <p>Another one of India’s Olympic heroes, Kumar became the first Indian to win back-to-back individual Olympic medals. He bettered his bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics by winning a silver at the 2012 London Games.

                Kumar belongs to the Baprola village in Najafgarh, Delhi. Initially a pure akhada wrestler, he was picked up by coach Satpal Singh, and the rest is now history.
                
                Apart from the Olympics medal, Kumar has won five Commonwealth Championships, one World Championship, one Asian Championship and two Commonwealth Games.
                
                The 31-year old has to be considered the finest wrestler this country has ever produced. From Najafgarh to London, all Indians would be hoping Kumar can go one better and win the gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics</p>

            <p>The name needs no introduction; Mary Kom is one of the finest athletes the country has ever produced. Her achievements list is endless – she’s a six-time World champion, four time Asian champion, Asian Games gold medallist and to top it all an Olympic bronze medallist.

                A biopic was recently made on her highlighting her popularity in the public sphere.
                
                But surprisingly, this world beater hails from the tiny Kangathei village in Manipur. Her story is not only inspirational, but is testament to the talent present in India’s rural areas.</p>

            <p>The Indian national cricket team pacer grew up in Valani, a miner village near Khaperkheda in the Nagpur district of Maharashtra. Before becoming a professional cricketer, Yadav had unsuccessfully attempted to join the Army and Police.

                While playing tennis ball cricket in Pandharkawda village in the Yavatmal district as a 20-year old, his friend received a call from the Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) asking him to bowl the next day.
                
                He didn’t have any shoes at that point, but now Yadav is one of the hottest properties in Indian cricket.</p>
