                <p>The former world number one, Kumari hails from the Ratucheti village in Jharkhand. The 21-year old
                    has won
                    three consecutive silver medals at the World Championships and also secured two gold medals at the
                    2010
                    Commonwealth Games.

                    Her father was an auto rickshaw driver, and she used to practise archery with bamboo bows and
                    arrows. She is
                    now training at the Tata Archery Academy in Jamshedpur for the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="players1">
                <p>India’s Olympic silver medallist in 2012, Kumar belongs to a small village known as Hasrour, which
                    only houses 60 families. It is located in the Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh. In addition to
                    his Olympics heroics, he has won five gold medals and one silver across two Commonwealth Games.

                    The 29-year old serves as a Subedar Major in the Indian Army and is supported by the Olympic Gold
                    Quest (OGQ)</p>

                <p>Another one of India’s Olympic heroes, Kumar became the first Indian to win back-to-back individual
                    Olympic medals. He bettered his bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics by winning a silver at the
                    2012 London Games.

                    Kumar belongs to the Baprola village in Najafgarh, Delhi. Initially a pure akhada wrestler, he was
                    picked up by coach Satpal Singh, and the rest is now history.

                    Apart from the Olympics medal, Kumar has won five Commonwealth Championships, one World
                    Championship, one Asian Championship and two Commonwealth Games.

                    The 31-year old has to be considered the finest wrestler this country has ever produced. From
                    Najafgarh to London, all Indians would be hoping Kumar can go one better and win the gold medal at
                    the 2016 Rio Olympics</p>

                <p>The name needs no introduction; Mary Kom is one of the finest athletes the country has ever produced.
                    Her achievements list is endless – she’s a six-time World champion, four time Asian champion, Asian
                    Games gold medallist and to top it all an Olympic bronze medallist.

                    A biopic was recently made on her highlighting her popularity in the public sphere.

                    But surprisingly, this world beater hails from the tiny Kangathei village in Manipur. Her story is
                    not only inspirational, but is testament to the talent present in India’s rural areas.</p>

                <p>The Indian national cricket team pacer grew up in Valani, a miner village near Khaperkheda in the
                    Nagpur district of Maharashtra. Before becoming a professional cricketer, Yadav had unsuccessfully
                    attempted to join the Army and Police.

                    While playing tennis ball cricket in Pandharkawda village in the Yavatmal district as a 20-year old,
                    his friend received a call from the Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) asking him to bowl the next
                    day.

                    He didn’t have any shoes at that point, but now Yadav is one of the hottest properties in Indian
                    cricket.</p>
